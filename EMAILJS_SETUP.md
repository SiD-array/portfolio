# EmailJS Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up EmailJS to receive contact form messages in your email.

## Step 1: Create EmailJS Account

1. Go to [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)

3. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Add Email Service

2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
4. Follow the setup instructions for your provider
5. **Important**: Note down your **Service ID** (starts with `service_`)

## Step 3: Create Email Template

1. Go to "Email Templates" in your dashboard
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template content:

```
Subject: New Contact Form Message from {{from_name}}

Hello,

You have received a new message from your portfolio contact form:

From: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
This message was sent from your portfolio website.
You can reply directly to this email to respond to {{from_name}}.
```

4. **Important**: Note down your **Template ID** (starts with `template_`)

## Step 4: Get Public Key

1. Go to "Account" in your EmailJS dashboard
2. Find your **Public Key** (also called User ID)
3. Copy this key

## Step 5: Update Configuration

1. Open `src/config/emailjs.js` in your project
2. Replace the placeholder values:

```javascript
export const EMAILJS_CONFIG = {
  SERVICE_ID: 'your_actual_service_id',      // From Step 2
  TEMPLATE_ID: 'your_actual_template_id',    // From Step 3
  PUBLIC_KEY: 'your_actual_public_key',      // From Step 4
  TO_EMAIL: 'sid.work0403@gmail.com'         // Your email (already set)
}
```

## Step 6: Test the Form

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the contact section
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check your email for the message

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid service ID"**: Double-check your service ID
2. **"Invalid template ID"**: Verify your template ID
3. **"Invalid public key"**: Make sure your public key is correct
4. **Emails not received**: Check your spam folder
